      <h1>Fate is in Your Hands</h1>
      <p>
        It's been a while since you've touched your tool box, but better now than later.
        You check the tires, and clean all the components of dirt and grime. Now that you've
        treated your bike with care, so it shall with you. With your helmet on, you take
        a strole up the town's creek path and hear the water lapping. You stop at your
        favorite coffee shop and sit down at one of the small tables. You think back to the relaxing day
        you've made for yourself and sigh while you look at the mountains. "I should do this every week!"
