        You just brewed some good Sh*t and don't want to cover up its
        subtle flavors with some milk and sugar. Now that your drink is made,
        you'd like to sit down and entertain yourself.

        To your left is a book you've been reading,
        and to your right is your computer with netflix queued up.
