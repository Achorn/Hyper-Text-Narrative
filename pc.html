        Oh no. Looks like you watched netflix in your room for hours, then
        switched to YouTube. It started with one video, but after a while,
        you stumbled upon the "Flat Earth" community and watched all their videos too!
        Sure, you don't believe that stuff, but for some reason you couldn't keep away
        from their obsurd reasonings and ideas. It's early into the next morning and
        you didn't get one wink of sleep. Looks like you missed class and Got an F on
        your important exam.
