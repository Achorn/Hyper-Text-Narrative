      <p>
        You mount the ol' road bike, and on your way up the creek path, your
        chain breaks. You try to slow down but your brakes seem to not be working either.
        As you start picking up speed, your front wheel starts to wobble, sending you off the path
        into a thick tree. Unfortunately, this caused you to die instantly.
        However, as you come to, you realize that death isn't that bad. All death is,
        is an html link to start over again and make things right.
